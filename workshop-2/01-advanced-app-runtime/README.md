## Exercise 1 - Use an Advanced Data Query

1. Pick one of the advanced data query functionality presented today
2. Implement a component using this functionality in [the `simple` CodeSandbox](https://githubbox.com/dhis2/academy-web-app-dev-2020/tree/master/workshop-2/01-advanced-app-runtime/simpoe?file=src/components/AdvancedQueryComponent.js).  You may use any query resource (or mutation)

## Exercise 2 - Pagination and Mutations
Open [the `pagination` CodeSandbox](https://githubbox.com/dhis2/academy-web-app-dev-2020/tree/master/workshop-2/01-advanced-app-runtime/pagination?file=README.md) and follow the instructions in [the README](./pagination/README.md)

> **NOTE** : Don't forget to fork the sandbox!

A [solution CodeSandbox](https://githubbox.com/dhis2/academy-web-app-dev-2020/tree/master/workshop-1/01-advanced-app-runtime/pagination-solution) is also available, though it does not include the Rename buttons

This is the same task as Exercise 2 of the App Runtime session in Workshop 1.  If you completed the Bonus problem for that exercise, you may re-use your existing solution (we can look it up for you if you don't remember the CodeSandbox URL)

## Exercise 3 - Coming soon!
